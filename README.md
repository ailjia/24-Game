# 24 Game

The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. 

Although an advanced version of the game will allow exponentiation, roots, logarithms, and other operations, in this task only the following basic operations are allowed: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses.

The goal is to find all possible combinations of a 24-card, which consists of 4 repeatable numbers from 1-9.
