# 24 Game

The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers (from 2 to 9) so that the end result is 24. 

Only three basic operations are allowed: addition, subtraction, multiplication. For simplicity, division and parentheses are not considered. Note that an advanced version of the game will also allow exponentiation, roots, logarithms, and other operations. 

The goal of this repository is to find all possible 24-cards.
