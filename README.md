# 24 Game

The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers (from 2 to 9) so that the end result is 24. 

For example, for the card with the numbers 9, 7, 8, 8, a possible solution is (9 - 7) * 8 + 8 = 24.

For simplicity, division and parentheses are not considered. Thus, only three basic operations are allowed: addition, subtraction, multiplication. Note that an advanced version of the game will also allow exponentiation, roots, logarithms, and other operations. 

The goal of this repository is to find all possible 24-cards.
